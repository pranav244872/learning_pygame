I've built a simple game called "Feed the Dragon". Here's what the game entails:

- **Objective**: Move the dragon vertically to catch coins falling from the top of the screen.
- **Gameplay**: 
  - Coins come from random positions at the right of the screen.
  - Use arrow keys or mouse to move the dragon up and down.
  - The player starts with a certain number of lives.
  - Missing a coin results in losing one life.
  - If lives reach 0, the game is over.
- **Scoring**: The player earns points for each coin caught.
- **Challenge**: Catch as many coins as possible while avoiding missing too many to survive longer.

### Game Controls

- **Up Arrow**: Move the dragon upward.
- **Down Arrow**: Move the dragon downward.
